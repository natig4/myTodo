This is a simple react todo app built with Hooks. 

This App uses the following technologies/libraries:

1. AWS AppSync
2. AWS Cognito
3. AWS Amplify
4. AWS DynamoDB
5. GraphQL
6. AWS Hosting.
7. Redux
8. Sass

This is my very first project using AWS technologies as well using GraphQL (I've been usually working with MongoDB).
You can see a live demo of this app here: https://dev.d3vqbfunpbb3o4.amplifyapp.com/
